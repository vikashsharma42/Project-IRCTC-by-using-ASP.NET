# Project-IRCTC-by-using-ASP.NET
#Project Description: Developed as part of my college coursework, the Online Train Ticket Booking System is a web-based application that allows users to seamlessly book train tickets. This project utilizes Aso.NET as the Entity framework and Razor Pages for the user interface, providing a practical demonstration of my skills in Asp.NET web development.

Project Description: The IRCTC e-Ticketing System is a web-based application developed using Asp.NET technologies like RazorPage.Bootstrap for the front-end and C# for the back-end. This system allows users to search for trains, book tickets, manage reservations, and view their booking history seamlessly. Key Features:

User Registration and Authentication: Users can register and create accounts, and then log in securely to access the system's functionalities.

Train Search and Booking: Users can search for trains based on various criteria such as source, destination, date, and class. Once a suitable train is found, they can book tickets for their desired journey.

Seat Availability Check: The system should provide real-time information about seat availability in different classes of trains, allowing users to make informed booking decisions.

Ticket Reservation and Cancellation: Users can reserve tickets for their chosen journey and cancel reservations if needed. The system should handle refunds and cancellations according to the IRCTC policies.

Payment Gateway Integration: Integration with a secure payment gateway allows users to make online payments for their bookings. It ensures the security of transactions and provides a smooth payment experience. In this project payment gateway id not real payment Gatewey.It is a part of ticket booking. User can use dummy card number or CVV number. Please donto use a real card number or cvv number.

Booking History: Users can view their past bookings, including details such as journey dates, train information, class, and status.

Technologies Used:

Front-End: Razor Pages (JSP), HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap. Back-End: C#, EntityFrameWork for ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) Database: SQL ServerL.

Database Design: Design the database schema to store user information, train details, reservations, and transaction history efficiently.

ORM Mapping: Use C# to map C# objects to database tables, allowing seamless interaction with the database.

User Interface Development: Design and develop user-friendly web pages using Razor Page, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide a smooth user experience.

Backend Development: Implement the business logic and functionalities using C#, ensuring proper validation and error handling at every step.

Integration: Integrate the application with a secure payment gateway for online transactions, and configure email/SMS services for automated notifications.

Testing: Conduct comprehensive testing to ensure the system is robust, secure, and free from bugs. Test various scenarios including booking, cancellation, and payment processes.

Documentation: Provide comprehensive documentation including user manuals, system architecture, and database schema for future reference and maintenance.

Project Extensions:

Seat Selection: Allow users to select their preferred seats while booking tickets, if applicable. Mobile App: Develop a mobile application version of the system for users to book tickets on the go. Integration with Travel APIs: Integrate with travel APIs to provide additional features such as hotel bookings, cab services, or tourist attractions information. By following this project description, you can develop a robust IRCTC e-Ticketing System using ASP.NET RazorPages, providing users with a seamless and efficient way to book train tickets online.
